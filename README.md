# PetrosSolver2.0
The first algorithm to solve, in polinomial time, the 3SAT problem

## Description

**PetrosSolver2.0** is an algorithm designed to solve the 3SAT problem in polynomial time. The 3SAT problem is a specific version of the Boolean satisfiability problem, where each clause in the formula has exactly three literals. This algorithm aims to determine whether a given 3SAT formula is satisfiable or not.

## Installation

To use PetrosSolver2.0, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pedrovinicius123/PetrosSolver2.0.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PetrosSolver2.0
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for the project:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the algorithm, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure that the `main.py` file contains the 3SAT formula you want to check. You can edit the file to include your own formula.
